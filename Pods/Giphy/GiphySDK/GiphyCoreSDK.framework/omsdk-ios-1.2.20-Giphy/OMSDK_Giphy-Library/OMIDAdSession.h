 * message is lost, and the verification scripts will not receive any events.
 *
 * To prevent this, the implementation must wait until the webview finishes loading OM SDK
 * JavaScript before creating the OMIDAdSession.  The easiest way is to create the OMIDAdSession
 * in a webview delegate callback (-[WKNavigationDelegate webView:didFinishNavigation:] or
 * -[UIWebViewDelegate webViewDidFinishLoad:]).  Alternatively, if an implementation can receive an
 * HTML5 DOMContentLoaded event from the webview, it can create the OMIDAdSession in a message
 * handler for that event.

 * @param context The context that provides the required information for initialising the ad session.
 * @return A new OMIDAdSession instance, or nil if the supplied context is nil.
